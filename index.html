     <p>I am a development agent in plant science by profession. I have worked particularly hard to spread agricultural technology that boost crop yield and productivity in rural communities. I enjoy spending the majority of my time resolving
      people's issues. I believe this is the reason I decided  to work as an agricultural development agent. Another example of this is my intention to get a degree  in community health. My life's mission is to support those who are in need. "No
      matter how strong you are, two is always better than one," is a proverb that is well-known in our nation. As a result, I think it's crucial that my coworkers and I work cooperatively. This is something I've developed through the course of
      my many <br> years of teamwork.</p>
